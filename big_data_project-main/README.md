I curated a tangible dating instruction manual, which explores the rules within dating specifically outlining the do’s and don’ts. The manual aims to highlight the wide range of views on dating whilst trying to find a common connection between all these different views. Using Twitter to extract and analyse the views the public has on dating and view various dating requirements.

The manual is illustrated similarly to an IKEA manual and the guidebook consists of tweets about people’s dating do’s and don’ts. The manual takes readers on a journey of the public's requirements and rules with dating. Each tweet is accompanied by amusing illustrations that relate to and reflections on the content of the tweet. The goal is to highlight the range of differing views towards dating. The manual ends with a review section based on aspects of dating like the talking stage and each aspect is displayed with a thumbs-up or down ranking system, based on positive or negative tweets about the topic.

The goal is to provide readers with a comedic and heartfelt manual that outlines peoples’ dating rules.
